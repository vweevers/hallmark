## Why

This module saves you time in three ways:

- **No configuration.** The easiest way to enforce markdown code quality in your project. No decisions to make. No `remark` plugins to manage.
- **Automatically format markdown.** Run `hallmark fix` to format markdown, wrap GitHub issues and usernames in links, autocomplete a `CHANGELOG.md` following [Common Changelog](https://common-changelog.org) and more.
- **Catch style issues & mistakes early.** Save code review time by eliminating back-and-forth between reviewer & contributor.

## Quick Start

Lint `*.md` files:

```
hallmark
```

Fix markdown files in place:

```
hallmark fix
```

Fix custom files:

```
hallmark fix CHANGELOG.md docs/*.md
```

Add new minor version or existing version to changelog, optionally without content:

```
hallmark cc add minor
hallmark cc add 4.2.0 --no-commits
```

## What You Might Do

Add `hallmark` to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "my-awesome-package",
  "devDependencies": {
    "hallmark": "^2.0.0"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "test": "hallmark && node my-tests.js"
  }
}
```

Markdown is then checked automatically when you run `npm test`:

```
$ npm test
README.md:5:3
  ⚠️  5:3  Found reference to undefined definition  remark-lint:no-undefined-references

  1 warning
```

## Usage

`hallmark [command] [options]`

Lint or fix files in the current working directory. The default command is `lint`.

Options:

- `--ignore / -i <file>`: file or glob pattern to ignore. Repeat to specify multiple (e.g. `-i a.md -i docs/*.md`). Can also be configured via [Package Options](#package-options).
- `--help`: print usage and exit
- `--version`: print version and exit
- `--report <reporter>`: see [Reporters](#reporters)
- `--[no-]color`: force color in report (detected by default)
- `--fix`: backwards-compatible alias for fix command

### Commands

#### `lint [file...]`

Lint markdown files. By default `hallmark` includes files matching `*.md`. To override this, provide one or more file arguments which can be file paths or glob patterns. Files matching `.gitignore` patterns are ignored. To ignore additional files, use the `--ignore / -i` option.

#### `fix [file...]`

Fix markdown files in place. The optional `file` argument is the same as on `lint`.

#### `cc add <target...>`

Add release(s) to `CHANGELOG.md` and populate it with commits. If no `CHANGELOG.md` file exists then it will be created. The `target` argument must be one of:

- A release type: `major`, `minor`, `patch`, `premajor`, `preminor`, `prepatch`, `prerelease`
  - These take the current version from the semver-latest tag, release or `package.json` (whichever is greatest if found) and bump it
  - The `major` type bumps the major version (for example `2.4.1 => 3.0.0`); `minor` and `patch` work the same way.
  - The `premajor` type bumps the version up to the next major version and down to a prerelease of that major version; `preminor` and `prepatch` work the same way.
  - The `prerelease` type works the same as `prepatch` if the current version is a non-prerelease. If the current is already a prerelease then it's simply incremented (for example `4.0.0-rc.2` to `4.0.0-rc.3`).
- A [semver-valid](https://semver.org/) version like 2.4.0.

If the (resulting) version is greater than the current version then commits will be taken from the semver-latest tag until HEAD. I.e. documenting a new release before it's git-tagged. If the version matches an existing tag then a release will be inserted at the appriopriate place, populated with commits between that version's tag and the one before it. I.e. documenting a past release after it's git-tagged. If the version equals `0.0.1` or `1.0.0` and zero versions exist, then a [notice](https://common-changelog.org/#23notice) will be inserted (rather than commits) containing the text `:seedling: Initial release.`.

Additional options for this command:

- `--no-commits`: create an empty release.

Multiple targets can be provided, in no particular order. For example `hallmark cc add 1.1.0 1.2.0` which acts as a shortcut for `hallmark cc add 1.1.0 && hallmark cc add 1.2.0`.

Works best on a linear git history without merge commits. If `hallmark` encounters other tags in the commit range it will stop there and not include further (older) commits.

The `cc add` command also fixes markdown (both existing content and generated content) but only in `CHANGELOG.md`. After you tweak the release following [Common Changelog](https://common-changelog.org) you may want to run `hallmark fix`.

Git [trailers](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-interpret-trailers) ("lines that look similar to RFC 822 e-mail headers, at the end of the otherwise free-form part of a commit message") can provide structured information to the generated changelog. The following trailer keys are supported (case-insensitive):

- `Category`: one of `change`, `addition`, `removal`, `fix`, or `none`. If `none` then the commit will be excluded from the changelog. If not present then the change will be listed under Uncategorized and will require manual categorization.
- `Notice`: a [notice](https://common-changelog.org/#23-notice) for the release. If multiple commits contain a notice, they will be joined as sentences (i.e. ending with a dot) separated by a space.
- `Ref`, `Refs`, `Fixes`, `Closes` or `CVE-ID`: a numeric reference in the form of `#N`, `PREFIX-N` or `CVE-N-N` where `N` is a number and `PREFIX` is at least 2 letters. For example `#123`, `GH-123`, `JIRA-123` or `CVE-2024-123`. Can be repeated, either with multiple trailer lines or by separating references with a comma - e.g. `Ref: #1, #2`. Non-numeric references are ignored.
- `Co-Authored-By`: co-author in the form of `name <email>`. Can be repeated.

For example, the following commit (which has Bob as git author, let's say):

```
Bump math-utils to 4.5.6

Ref: JIRA-123
Category: change
Co-Authored-By: Alice <alice@example.com>
```

Turns into:

```md
## Changed

- Bump math-utils to 4.5.6 (d23ba8f) (JIRA-123) (Bob, Alice)
```

#### `cc init`

Create a `CHANGELOG.md` from scratch. Inserts releases for every (semver-valid) git tag and then populates them with commits. If no git tags exist then the resulting `CHANGELOG.md` will merely have a `# Changelog` heading, without releases.

Additional options for this command:

- `--no-commits`: create empty releases
- `--gte <version>`: only include versions greater than or equal to this version
- `--lte <version>`: only include versions less than or equal to this version.

## Package Options

You can add a `hallmark` object to your `package.json` with additional configuration. For example:

```json
{
  "name": "my-awesome-package",
  "hallmark": {
    "ignore": [
      "CONTRIBUTING.md"
    ]
  }
}
```

Alternatively, for use in non-node projects, place a `.hallmarkrc` file in the working directory or any of its parent directories:

```json
{
  "ignore": [
    "CONTRIBUTING.md"
  ]
}
```

### `ignore`

A string or array of files to ignore. Merged with `--ignore / -i` if any.

### `autolinkReferences`

Autolink custom references [like GitHub Pro](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/administering-a-repository/configuring-autolinks-to-reference-external-resources) does. Must be an object with a `prefix` and `url` (if `autolinkReferences` is not set, this feature does nothing). For example, given:

```json
{
  "autolinkReferences": {
    "prefix": "JIRA-",
    "url": "https://example.atlassian.net/browse/JIRA-<num>"
  }
}
```

Then `hallmark fix` will transform:

```md
### Fixed

- Prevent infinite loop (JIRA-4275)
```

To:

```md
### Fixed

- Prevent infinite loop ([JIRA-4275](https://example.atlassian.net/browse/JIRA-4275))
```

While `hallmark lint` will warn about unlinked references.

### `changelog`

An object containing options to be passed to [`remark-common-changelog`](https://github.com/vweevers/remark-common-changelog):

- `submodules` (boolean): enable experimental git submodule support. Will (upon encountering new or empty changelog entries) collect commits from submodules and list them in the changelog as `<submodule>: <message>`.

### `validateLinks`

Boolean. Set to `false` to skip validating links. Useful when a markdown file uses HTML anchors, which not are not recognized as links. A temporary option until we decide whether to allow and parse those.

### `paddedTable`

Boolean. Set to `false` to keep markdown tables compact. A temporary option until we decide on and are able to lint a style ([`3210a96`](https://github.com/vweevers/hallmark/commit/3210a96)).

### `toc`

Boolean. Set to `false` to skip generating (or replacing) a Table of Contents. A temporary option until we write a more flexible plugin ([#36](https://github.com/vweevers/hallmark/issues/36)).

### `plugins`

An array of extra plugins, to be applied in both lint and fix mode.

### `fixers`

An array of extra plugins, to be applied in fix mode.

## Opt-in Features

### Table of Contents

_Note: this feature is likely to change ([#36](https://github.com/vweevers/hallmark/issues/36))._

Add this heading to a markdown file:

```markdown
## Table of Contents
```

Running `hallmark fix` will then create or update a table of contents.

## Reporters

The default reporter is [`vfile-reporter-shiny`](https://github.com/vweevers/vfile-reporter-shiny). Various other reporters are available:

- [`vfile-reporter`](https://npmjs.org/package/vfile-reporter)
- [`vfile-reporter-json`](https://npmjs.org/package/vfile-reporter-json)
- [`vfile-reporter-pretty`](https://npmjs.org/package/vfile-reporter-pretty)

To use a custom reporter first install it with [npm](https://npmjs.org):

```
npm i vfile-reporter-json --save-dev
```

Then pass it to `hallmark` with or without options:

```
hallmark --report json
hallmark --report [ json --pretty ]
```

In the programmatic API of `hallmark` (which is not documented yet) the reporter can also be disabled by passing `{ report: false }` as the options.

## Install

With [npm](https://npmjs.org) do:

```
npm install hallmark --save-dev
```
